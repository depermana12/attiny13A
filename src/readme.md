1. `toggleLedOn` This function sets the `ledState` variable to `HIGH` and turns on the LED by setting `PB0` pin to `HIGH`.
2. `toggleLedBlink` This function is called when the LED is on (`ledState` is `HIGH`). It uses the `millis()` function to toggle the LED every 5 seconds (interval is set to 5000 milliseconds). The `ledState` is inverted (`HIGH` to `LOW` or `LOW` to `HIGH`) and the state of `PB0` pin is updated accordingly.
3. `toggleLedOff` This function sets the `ledState` variable to `LOW` and turns off the LED by setting `PB0` pin to `LOW`.
4. The loop function now includes calls to these functions based on the button state and LED state. The LED is turned on when the button is pressed (`buttonState` changes to `LOW`) using the `toggleLedOn` function. If the LED is on (`ledState` is `HIGH`), the `toggleLedBlink` function is called to blink the LED. Finally, the `sleep` function is called to put the microcontroller into sleep mode until the next interrupt occurs.
